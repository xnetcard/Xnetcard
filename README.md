ID Card Generator v4.0 — Official College Style (90×60 mm)

Files:
- index.html — two-step Form -> Preview -> Download flow
- styles.css — card styling for 90×60 mm
- README.md — usage notes

How to use:
1. Unzip and open `index.html` in a browser OR upload the three files to a GitHub repository and enable GitHub Pages.
2. Fill the form (all fields are optional/editable). Upload photo/logo/signature as needed.
3. Click **Preview ID Card** — you'll see the generated card in official style.
4. Download PNG or PDF from the preview screen.

Notes:
- The watermark uses the uploaded logo if provided; otherwise it shows the school name faintly as background text.
